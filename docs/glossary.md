- JSON-RPC: A simple way to call a remote server using JSON messages. You send a method and params, and you get a JSON response.
- eth_getBlockByNumber: An Ethereum JSON-RPC method that returns a block by its number (hex like `0x...`) or by `latest`. It can return only transaction hashes (`false`) or full transactions (`true`).
